# random_image_generator
A microservice for Jade's OSU's CS361 project

## Overview ##
The microservice accepts a keyword query, uses the Unsplash API to find a random image, and returns a JSON object with the image info.

The API account you'll make for Unsplash will be in demo mode, which means it's limited to 50 requests per hour. To prevent disruptions, the microservice stores the last 500 images in `fallback_store.json` and returns a random image if there are API errors stemming from rate limits or anything else.

Up to 500 images are stored in fallback_store.json. If something goes wrong with the Unsplash API, the microservice will return an image from the fallback store.

## Communication policy ##

#### How to programatically REQUEST data ####
Use Python's ZeroMQ package to communicate with the microservice.
Create a request socket and bind it to tcp://localhost:5555

Example call:
```
socket.send_string("icecream")
```

#### How to programatically RECEIVE data ####
Use the recv() method. The microservice will return a JSON object which includes details about a single random image.
```
ice_cream_json = socket.recv()
```

## Setup ##

#### Unsplash API ####

The microservice uses the Unsplash API, so you'll need an API account. Follow these steps:

2. Create an account if you donâ€™t have one.
3. Register a new application and copy your **Access Key**.

#### .env  ####

Create a `.env` file and add your access key:

   ```dotenv
    ACCESS_KEY=your_access_kewy
```

#### Dependencies ####
To install the required packages, use the following command:
